    "## *Python for Everybody*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Python for Everybody* is a free online textbook published under the Creative Commons Licence that is a great starter and reference guide for python.  Most of the lab excersises will be based on sections of *Python for Everybody* - in fact, its a great starting reference and could contain hints to solving every excersise, should you get stuck.  It breaks down the basics of python and programming as a whole, as many of the concepts we'll cover talking about python apply to almost every programming language.  The book itself is availible for purchase if you're *really* interested in a print copy, but it available as a PDF and epub from the writer for free [here](https://www.py4e.com/book.php).  Some sections of *Python for Everybody* have been adapted from another book, *How to think like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python* by Allen Downey, Jeff Elkner and Chris Meyers.  This book is also available for free online [here](https://greenteapress.com/wp/learning-with-python/)."
